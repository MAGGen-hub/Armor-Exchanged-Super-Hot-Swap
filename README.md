Armor Exchanged Super Hot Swap is a merged version of two mods named Armor Exchanger and Armor Hot Swap.

Right click while holding a piece of armor to hotswap it with your current armor.  

I need to say that I am not very good at porting mods to other versions so this one is supported only for 1.16.1 - 1.16.5.

I warn you! This version is NOT tested on server (not enough testers to do it) but config allow you to run this mod on server now. But please be careful!

I hope AreUThreateningMe(kregerl) and StephenBarnes port my code to their mods for other versions support.

If you want to use something like this with fabric mod loader download Inventory Control Tweaks from curseforge.

Please see authors repositories!

Players can use a config option to allow or disallow equipping armor with curse enchantments.
By default players are NOT allowed to equip armor with curse enchantments (unequip too!).
